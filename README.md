Latex Docker Container
=====

This container contains LaTeX and some extras as more fonts and packages as moderncv.

This container helps compiling latex sources without the need to install all
latex packages on your system.

There is a volume `/data` where the generated files are going to be stored.

Setup
-----
First, add your local user to docker group:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker <YOURUSERNAME>
```

Pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/devng/pdflatex):
```
docker pull devng/latex
```

or build it locally:
```
docker build -t devng/latex .
```

Usage:
-----
An example of usage could be:

```
./pdflatex-docker.sh example.tex
```

Note that sometimes you need to compile a TEX file twice in order to produce a PDF document.

To clean the the files temp files generated by pdflatex run:
```
rm -f *.{aux,log,out}
```
